Simple python application that shows the weather forecast data of all airports in Turkey. 
Application uses API Ninjas' airports api(https://api-ninjas.com/api/airports) for listing the airports then uses OpenWeatherMap's current weather data api(https://openweathermap.org/current) to get the current weather forecast of that location and displays this information on a map created using tkintermapview library by Tom Schimansky(https://github.com/TomSchimansky/TkinterMapView).
